# CivElevator
Independent plugin for civ's private/personal servers for 1.18.2. Designed to be absolutely light weight and minimal.

All credits goes to the civ developers who contributed to SimpleAdminHacks repo, where GoldElevator resided in!
I (KingColton1; IGN CapColt and CapianColton) modified some portions of codes to be decoupled from the mainline plugins and added config.yml file to customize elevator block and sound for your preferance.
